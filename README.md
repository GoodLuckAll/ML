# Lecture 1: The Learning Problem

## **Foundation Oriented ML Course**

* Story-like:

  * **When **Can Machines Learn? \(illustrative + technical\)

  * **Why **Can Machines Learn? \(theoretical + illustrative\)

  * **How **Can Machines Learn? \(technical + practical\)

  * How Can Machines Learn **Better**? \(practical + theoretical\)

## From Learning to Machine Learning

## The Machine Learning Route

ML: an **alternative route **to build complicated systems

**Some Use Scenarios**

* when human cannot program the system manually

        -&gt; _navigating on Mars_

* when human cannot ‘define the solution’ easily

        -&gt; _speech/visual recognition_

* when needing rapid decisions that humans cannot do

        -&gt; _high-frequency trading_

* when needing to be user-oriented in a massive scale

        -&gt; _consumer-targeted marketing_
